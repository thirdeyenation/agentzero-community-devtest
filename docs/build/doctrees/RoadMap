1. Introduction
- Agent Zero is a cutting-edge, adaptive AI framework designed to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. It represents a leap forward in AI technology, combining advanced natural language processing, dynamic cognitive architectures, ethical decision-making, and continuous self-improvement capabilities. The project aims to create an AI system that can adapt to a wide range of tasks, learn from its experiences, and collaborate effectively with humans and other AI agents.

## The primary goals of Agent Zero are:
 - To develop an AI system capable of understanding and executing complex, multi-step tasks across various domains.
 - To create an AI that can explain its decision-making processes transparently and ethically.
 - To build a system that continuously learns and improves its capabilities through interaction and self-reflection.
 - To establish a framework for AI-human collaboration that enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them.
### As an award-winning AI project, Agent Zero sets new standards in AI research and development, focusing on adaptability, explainability, and ethical considerations in artificial intelligence.


## Key concepts
1) General-purpose assistant
 - Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.
 - It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.

2) Computer as a tool
 - Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.
 - The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.
 - Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.

3) Multi-agent cooperation
- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.
 - In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.
 - Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.

4) Completely customizable and extensible
- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.
 - The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the prompts/default/agent.system.md file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.
 - The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.
 - Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop, can be found in the prompts/ folder and changed.
 - Every default tool can be found in the python/tools/ folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.
- Of course, it is open-source (except for some tools like Perplexity, but that will be replaced with an open-source alternative as well in the future).

5) Communication is key
- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.
 - Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.
 - The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.
- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates' results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.
